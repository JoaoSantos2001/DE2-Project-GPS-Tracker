# DE2-Project-GPS-Tracker
Objetive: 
GPS-based environmental sensor data logger. The system integrates GPS functionality for location tracking and environment sensor(s) to capture data related to environmental conditions. 
The project aims to log and display sensor data and provide the capability to export the collected information for analysis.

# Team Members
Group 3 - BPA-DE2:
- Henrique Silva --> Responsible for Monitor library and main code
- Guilherme Brito --> Responsible for Documentation and main code
- JoÃ£o Santos -->  Responsible for GPS library and main code

# Hardware description
(Describe your implementation and include block or circuit diagram(s).)

# Software description
(Present the modules you used in the project.)
Modules Used in the Project:
1. machine
    -Used to interface with hardware components like I2C and UART for communication with the OLED and GPS modules.
2. sh1106
    -A library created in class for controlling SH1106-based OLED displays via the I2C interface.
3. time
    -Used for implementing delays (e.g., refreshing the display every second).
4. libGPS (MicropyGPS)
    -A library for parsing NMEA data from the GPS module and extracting useful information like latitude, longitude, altitude, and time.
    -Library that was adapted to have the best look for the project and for the used OLED display.

(Put *flowchats* of your algorithm(s) and direct links to source files.)

# Instructions and photos
1. Connect the jumper in order to connect all 3 devices (ESP32, GPS Module and OLED Display) as shown in the figure below.

![Circuit_Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/455a3f9e-e92e-44d7-beff-9a5b6a6256fd)

-Obtaining something like this:

![Circuit_Display_OFF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbf682d3-a843-4b10-9210-2700e9cbede7)

2. After all the connections made, connect the usb to your computer and your ESP32 and upload **sh1106** and **libGPS** modules to the ESP32 memory.
    -sh1106 Responsible for OLED Display functions
    -libGPS Responsible for collect data from GPS's

3. Once the modules are uploaded with the application **Thonny** or one look a like that can work with the ESP32 open the main code **Main_v2.0.py** and run it.

NOTES:

1. The GPS Module can take a few seconds or minutes to start detecting Satellites.

2. In case you are inside a building and unable to connect to Satellites, try to move close to a window or even try to go outside.

-Results:

The photo below shows the output on the OLED display and on the command line (Thonny), respectively.

-Working Project:

This video and the next show the code running and the both available outputs, OLED Display Output and Command Line Output, respectively.

We can notice a difference in the outputs on the Dislpay and on Thonny, this was a group decision, once the OLED Display has a limited space we decided to only insert some of the parameters available as once the command line doesn't have that limit we print all the parametrs.

(Describe how to use the application. Add photos or videos of your application.)

# Output analysis

-**Date** -> in format DD/MM/YYYY, this parameter can be change on *Main_v2.0.py* in line xx.
-**Time** -> in format HH:MM:SS, this parameter can be change on *Main_v2.0.py* in line xx.
-**Lat** (Latitude) -> Latitude displayed in short format, this format can be change on *Main_v2.0.py* in line xx.
-**Long** (Longitude) -> Longitude displayed in short format, this format can be change on *Main_v2.0.py* in line xx.
-**Altitude** -> Altitude relative to sea level in meters.
-**Speed** -> Speed in Km/h, this parametercan be change to mph on *Main_v2.0.py* in line xx.
-**N Satellites** (Number of Satellites) -> Number of Satellites available from witch is possible to collect data.
-**Position Dilution of Precision** -> A measure of overall GPS accuracy based on satellite geometry; lower values mean better accuracy.
-**Horizontal Dilution of Precision** -> Accuracy of GPS position on the horizontal plane (latitude and longitude).
-**Vertical Dilution of Precision** -> Accuracy of GPS position in the vertical dimension (altitude).

NOTES:

1. In some of the tests we saw that the initial accuracy it's not the best recomending to leave it for some seconds before starting analising data.

2. The choosen format was made in order to save space on the OLED Display beeng this small.
